That’s what we are thinking now, but let us see how the next year goes in terms of demand. The first six months are crucial after the launch of any product\", Gopalakrishnan said.\\n\\nThe EV maker launched its Atto 3 e-sport-utility vehicle (SUV) in India on Tuesday, its first passenger electric vehicle for the local market.\\n\\nWhile BYD will disclose the price of the electric SUV after a month, Gopalakrishnan said that the product would be positioned at the premium end of the market.\\n\\nGopalakrishnan said BYD expects to sell nearly 15,000 units of the Atto 3 and its multi-utility vehicle e6 in India by the end of next year.\\n\\nBYD is already one of India’s largest electric bus players through its partnership with Olectra, a unit of Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Ltd, which uses parts and technology from BYD for its manufacturing operations.\\n\\nThe buses are sold in India under the Olectra brand.\\n\\nBYD will not explore a similar technological partnership for passenger vehicles, Gopalakrishnan said.\\n\\nAt the moment, it also isn’t considering starting battery manufacturing in India, keeping in mind the current volumes.\\n\\nGopalakrishnan said that China’s BYD has had a good run in the passenger vehicle business over the past few months and is turning its attention to overseas markets.\\n\\n“Globally, the last seven-eight months have been big for BYD—we have launched in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Thailand, and we’ll soon be in Europe.
